This repository contains the course materials from Math 157: Intro to Mathematical Software, taught by Kiran Kedlaya at UC San Diego during the winter 2018 quarter. These were adapted from a similar course (Math 152) taught by Kedlaya at UCSD during winter 2017, and ultimately from several courses (Math 480) taught by William Stein at University of Washington.

The solution sets for the exercises were prepared by the Math 157 TAs: Thomas Grubb, Jun Bo Lau, and Peter Wear. Additional contributions were made by Alina Bucur, Alyson Deines, John Jeng, Harald Schilly, and Kartik Venkatram.
